# Chatbot Web Application

## Overview

This project focuses on building a chatbot web application similar to ChatGPT. The project leverages large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing, with an interface that allows switching between different models and creating intelligent agents to handle specific tasks.

Basically like this:

### Features
- **Responsive Front-End**: An interactive and user-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbot, allowing you to change parameters like output length, model temperature, and more. 
- **Back-End Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs)**: The core engine is powered by different LLMs (e.g., GPT,  ChatGLM, LLaMA etc.).
- **Model Switching**: Ability to switch between various LLMs, enabling users to choose the best model for their needs.
- **Agent Creation**: Custom agents can be created for specific tasks or specialized conversations (e.g., Q&A, code generation, content summarization).

## Application Architecture

### Front-End
The front-end is built using web technologies including:

**Gradio**: A powerful Python-based library used to create customizable user interfaces. It simplifies the integration of machine learning models into web applications with minimal code, offering a clean, intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

### Back-End
The back-end integrates LLMs using:
- **Hugging Face Models**: Support for various pre-trained models through the Hugging Face API.
- **OpenAI API**: For advanced LLMs like GPT-4.
- **Local Language Models**: utilizing locally hosted language models on the serve.
